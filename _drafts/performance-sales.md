Our Ecommerce platforms account for a large percentage of revenue across companies in the group.
Dreamworld Online shop does about 25% of the total ticket revenue.

We have just recently got onboard with New Relic for detailed server performance monitoring and I must say its awesome!

Tools we use
<ul>
    <li>New Relic</li>
    <li>MiniProfiler</li>
    <li>Google Analytics</li>
</ul>

Database Queries: Linq-to-SQL is slow, dapperfy those queries!
Front end bottleneck: Less JS and CSS (work in progress)
