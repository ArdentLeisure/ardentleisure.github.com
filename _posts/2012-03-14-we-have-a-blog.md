<p>
	Lately we have been on the lookup for some great developers to join our awesome team but the response hasn't been as good as we hoped.
</p>

<p>
	Which got me thinking, <strong>Why aren't developers lining up to work at Ardent Leisure?</strong> The answer is: No one knows about us or about what we do.
	So this blog was created to help get the Ardent Leisure name out amongst developers and maybe help out the community a bit along the way.
</p>

<p>
	You're probably thinking <em>"Why should I care what you do in your little team?"</em> and with good reason.
	We have a team of 4 developers and 2 business analyists and we get to tackle some massive projects such as PurpleSmoke, which was a complete rebuild of the Dreamworld, White WaterWorld and SkyPoint ecommerce platforms making sure its fast, scalable and tighlty integrated into existing system.
	We also have massive amounts of data that we get to work with on a daily basis. Goodlife have 46 gyms across Australia all synchronising data to our central server using SQL Server replication.
</p>

<p><strong>What's Next?</strong></p>
<p>I am planning on making 2012 a great year for Ardent Leisure among the developer community and to do this I am going to do 3 main things:</p>
<ul>
    <li>This blog, posting about who we are and some of the great things we are doing</li>
    <li>User groups, conferences and other community events, both attending and presenting (hopefully)</li>
    <li>Open source, planning on getting more involved in the open source community by created some of our own projects as well as contributing to others</li>
</ul>
