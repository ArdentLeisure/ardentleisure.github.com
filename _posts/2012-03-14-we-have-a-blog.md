	Lately we have been on the lookup for some great developers to join our awesome team but the response hasn't been as good as we hoped.
</p>

<p>
	Which got me thinking, <strong>Why aren't developers lining up to work at Ardent Leisure?</strong> The answer is: No one knows about us or about what we do.
	So this blog was created to help get the Ardent Leisure name out amongst developers and maybe help out the community a bit along the way.
</p>

<p>
	You're probably thinking <em>"Why should I care what you do in your little team?"</em> and with good reason.
	We have a team of 4 developers and 2 business analyists and we get to tackle some massive projects such as PurpleSmoke, which was a complete rebuild of the Dreamworld, White WaterWorld and SkyPoint ecommerce platforms making sure its fast, scalable and tighlty integrated into existing system.
	We also have massive amounts of data that we get to work with on a daily basis. Goodlife have 46 gyms across Australia all synchronising data to our central server using SQL Server replication.
